Check the running jobs and the job queues for jobs that belong to
users who are no longer active (grace or inactive)

If the state field in the LDAP equals
    - grace: remove jobs from the queue
    - inactive: remove running jobs and jobs from the queue

Script can be run with the following options:
    - --dry-run: just check, take no action and report on what would be done
    - --debug: set logging level to DEBUG instead of INFO

This script is running on the masters, which are at Python 2.6.x.
